      Hi, my name is <b class="text-lime-500">Sreyvang PHON</b>, and I’m a passionate frontend web
      developer who truly enjoys turning ideas into real, interactive
      websites and applications. I specialize in building clean, responsive,
      and user-friendly designs using modern tools like HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and popular frameworks such as Vue or React. <br /><br />

      I love learning about new technologies and always try to improve my
      skills to stay updated with what’s happening in the tech world. In my
      free time, I contribute to open-source projects and experiment with
      creative UI designs to sharpen my frontend abilities.

      <br /><br />

      What makes me different is not just my technical skill, but also my
      strong focus on user experience. I believe that good design isn’t only
      about how it looks—but also how it works. I enjoy working with teams,
      sharing ideas, and finding the best way to build smooth and beautiful
      websites that people enjoy using.

      <br /><br />

      If you’re looking for someone who is curious, hard-working, and ready
      to bring value to your team—I’d love the opportunity to show you what
      I can do.
